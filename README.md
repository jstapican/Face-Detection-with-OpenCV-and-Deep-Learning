# Face-Detection-with-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning

OpenCV Facial Recognition using Deep Learning using Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework with ResNet as the base network. 
This serves as an alternative to OpenCV Haar Cascades.

Todo:
> Detection fails with lower resolution images.
> Still need to check detection with images taken in an angle and partially obstructed facial images.
> Detection failed with images with dark shades.
> Still need to check the code for Facial Recognition with regards to Video files and video steam
